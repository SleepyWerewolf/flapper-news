Backend team:
- Your role is to implement a dynamic REST API, so that anyone can interact with our application through HTTP requests.
- You will be working on the back end branch (back-end), which will have just the raw HTML and Angular code produced from the front end team's Part 1 tutorial.
- Depending on how far you get, you can also work on integrating Stormpath into the application (the tutorial uses Passport, which is a similar authentication library).
