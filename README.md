Frontend team:

Your role is to put together the initial Angular front end, and to develop first-hand experience with HTML, CSS, and Angular.js.
Your workshop will be split into two parts: 1) working in the empty branch (front-end-part-1), and put together from scratch some raw HTML and Angular code 2) working in the branch with a partially implemented backend (front-end-part-2), and create a persistent application, where front end interactions are binded to the database
